**"Homepage"** is a tiny tool for Web developers.

It lists automatically all your local sites within your apache "www" directory and gives you a link to easily access your local sites by using some HTML, CSS and PHP.



Project inspired from : [CMALL/LocalHomePage](https://github.com/cmall/LocalHomePage), code lines are my own.

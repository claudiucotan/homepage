**"Homepage"** is a tiny tool for Web developers.

It lists automatically all your local sites within your apache "www" directory and gives you a link to easily access your local sites by using some HTML, CSS and PHP.

To use it, simply do:

```
cd /LOCATION_WHERE_YOUR_APACHE_WEB_FILES_ARE_STRORED/ #example: cd /Users/claudiucotan/Sites/
git clone https://github.com/claudiucotan/homepage.git

```
Then start your favorite web browser and go to

```
http://localhost

```
